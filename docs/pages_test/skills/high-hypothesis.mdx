# High Hypothesis

Generates plausible explanations for detected anomalies with confidence levels.

## Overview

This skill analyzes detected anomalies and generates hypotheses about potential root causes. It considers available evidence, deployment history, service dependencies, and other contextual factors to suggest possible explanations.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Anomalies are detected and need explanation
- Investigating incidents with unclear causes
- Adding context to reports
- Supporting decision-making with possible scenarios

## Directory Structure

```
high_hypothesis/
├── SKILL.md
└── scripts/
    └── run.py
```

## Instructions

1. **Receive anomalies**: Accept output from `detect_anomalies`

2. **Load contextual data**: Read `config/deployment_history.json` and `config/service_dependencies.yaml`

3. **Run hypothesis generator**: Execute analysis script

4. **Outputs**: Return hypotheses with confidence and evidence

5. **Save hypotheses**: Write to `output/hypotheses.json`

6. **Pass to summary**: Provide hypotheses to `generate_summary`

## Input

```json
{
  "anomalies": [...],
  "metrics": {...},
  "context": {
    "recent_deployments": [...],
    "dependencies": [...]
  }
}
```

## Output

```json

  "hypotheses": [
    {
      "id": "hyp_001",
      "anomaly_id": "anom_001",
      "hypothesis": "Recent deployment at 14:15 may correlate with increased DB_TIMEOUT errors",
      "confidence": 0.75,

        "No alerts from database monitoring"
      ],

        "Review database slow query logs"
      ]

  "confidence_note": "These are plausible explanations, not confirmed root causes"
}

## Hypothesis Structure

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique hypothesis identifier |
| `anomaly_id` | Link to related anomaly |
| `hypothesis` | Description of possible cause |
| `confidence` | Confidence level (0-1) |
| `evidence` | Supporting evidence |
| `uncertainty_factors` | Factors that reduce confidence |
| `suggested_validation` | Steps to validate hypothesis |

## Important Notes

- Always mark hypotheses as possibilities, not facts
- Include uncertainty factors
- Provide validation steps
- Never hallucinate root causes
