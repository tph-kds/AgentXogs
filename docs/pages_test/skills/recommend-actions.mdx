# Recommend Actions

Suggests concrete, testable actions for operators and developers based on analysis findings.

## Overview

This skill takes detected anomalies and hypotheses and translates them into prioritized action items. It uses predefined action templates to suggest remediation steps, investigation procedures, and preventive measures.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Anomalies or risks are identified
- Human intervention is required
- Creating action plans for incidents
- Prioritizing remediation efforts

## Directory Structure

```
recommend_actions/
├── SKILL.md
├── scripts/
│   └── run.py
└── config/
    └── action_templates.yaml
```

## Instructions

1. **Receive analysis results**: Accept outputs from `detect_anomalies`, `high_hypothesis`, and `generate_summary`

2. **Load action templates**: Read `config/action_templates.yaml`

3. **Run recommendation engine**: Execute action generation script

4. **Outputs**: Return prioritized recommendations

5. **Save recommendations**: Write to `output/recommendations.json`

6. **Present to user**: Display in priority order with clear steps

## Input

```json
{
  "anomalies": [...],
  "hypotheses": [...],
  "service_context": {...}
}
```

## Recommendation Structure

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique recommendation identifier |
| `priority` | Priority level (high/medium/low) |
| `category` | Type of action (investigation/monitoring/alerting/optimization) |
| `action` | Brief description of the action |
| `rationale` | Why this action is recommended |
| `steps` | Step-by-step instructions |
| `estimated_time` | Expected time to complete |
| `related_anomaly` | Link to related anomaly |

## Priority Levels

- **High**: Immediate action required, significant impact
- **Medium**: Should be addressed soon, moderate impact
- Low**: Can be scheduled, minor impact
