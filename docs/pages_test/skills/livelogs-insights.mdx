# Live Logs Insights

The main orchestration skill that coordinates the complete log analysis pipeline.

## Overview

This skill is the entry point for comprehensive log analysis. It activates and coordinates all other skills in sequence to transform raw logs into actionable insights.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when:
- User requests log analysis or system health insights
- Daily/weekly operational summaries are needed
- Investigating incidents or unusual behavior
- Monitoring production or staging systems

## Directory Structure

```
livelogs_insights/
├── SKILL.md              # This file
└── scripts/
    └── run.py           # Orchestration script
```

## Instructions

1. **Read configuration**: Load `config/log_sources.yaml` and `config/anomaly_thresholds.yaml`

2. **Execute pipeline**: Run the orchestration script with input parameters

3. **Pipeline stages**: The script coordinates:
   - `logsource_discovery` - Identifies log sources
   - `fetch_logs` - Retrieves raw logs
   - `parse_logs` - Normalizes log formats
   - `aggregate_logs` - Computes metrics
   - `detect_anomalies` - Identifies issues
   - `high_hypothesis` - Generates explanations (optional)
   - `generate_summary` - Creates report
   - `recommend_actions` - Suggests next steps

4. **Review outputs**: Results are written to `output/`:
   - `summary.md` - Human-readable report
   - `anomalies.json` - Detected issues
   - `recommendations.json` - Action items
   - `metrics.json` - Aggregated statistics
   - `hypotheses.json` - Root cause hypotheses

5. **Present findings**: Include:
   - Executive summary of system health
   - Key anomalies with confidence levels
   - Root cause hypotheses (when available)
   - Prioritized recommendations
   - Supporting metrics and evidence

6. **Handle errors**: If pipeline fails:
   - Log the error with context
   - Return partial results if available
   - Suggest manual investigation steps
   - Never hallucinate missing data

## Input Parameters

```json
{
  "time_range": "24h",
  "environment": "production",
  "service_name": "auth-service",
  "severity_filter": "ERROR"
}
```

## Output

The skill orchestrates all pipeline stages and produces comprehensive analysis reports.
